## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -t -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio.git

# Go into the repository
cd developerFolio

# Setup default environment variables

# For Linux
cp env.example .env
# For Windows
copy env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your GitHub token like this, also add your username as `GITHUB_USERNAME`

```env
// .env
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
GITHUB_USERNAME = "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"
USE_GITHUB_DATA = "true"
```

Set `showGithubProfile` to true or false to show Contact Profile using GitHub, defaults to false.

**Warning:** Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs.

Note: Open Source Projects section only show pinned items of your GitHub.
If you are seeing something as shown below, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

If the above solution still doesn't work, visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/wiki/Github-Setup-For-Open-Source-Projects).

## Linking blogs section to Medium

Optionally, you can link the blogs section to your medium user account:

* Inside the .env file, add key `MEDIUM_USERNAME` and assign your Medium username

```env
// .env
MEDIUM_USERNAME = "YOUR MEDIUM USERNAME"
```

* For Github Action, change the environment variable `MEDIUM_USERNAME` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Set `displayMediumBlogs` to true or false in portofolio.js to display fetched Medium blogs, defaults to true.

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need. You will also need to modify `index.html` to change the title and metadata to provide accurate SEO for your personal portfolio.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

const greeting = {
  /* Your Summary And Greeting Section */
  title: "Hi all I'm Saad",
  subTitle: emoji("A passionate Full Stack Software Developer üöÄ"),
  resumeLink: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofFdKF_mqscH8WvXkSObnVvC9kK7Ldlu/view?usp=sharing"
};

const socialMediaLinks = {
  /* Your Social Media Link */
  github: "https://github.com/saadpasta",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadpasta/",
  gmail: "saadpasta70@gmail.com",
  gitlab: "https://gitlab.com/saadpasta",
  facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/saad.pasta7"
};


const skillsSection = { .... }

const techStack = { .... }

const workExperience = { .... }

const openSource = { .... }

const bigProjects = { .... }

const achievementSection = { .... }

const blogSection = { .... }

const contactInfo = { .... }

const twitterDetails = { ... }

```
#### Resume upload
To upload your own resume, simply upload a pdf to `src/containers/resume` and rename the pdf to `resume.pdf`. 

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.

#### Adding Twitter Time line to your Page
Insert your Twitter username in `portfolio.js` to show your recent activity on your page.

```javascript
const twitterDetails = {
  userName : "Your Twitter Username"
};
```
Note: Don't use `@` symbol when adding username.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.

The Profile and the Repository information from GitHub is only created at the time of deploy and the site needs to be redeployed if those information needs to be updated. So, a configurable [CRON Job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) is setup which deploys your site every week, so that once you update your profile on GitHub it is shown on your portfolio. You can also trigger it manually using `workflow_dispatch` event, see [this guide](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch) on how to do that.

- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend to read through the [GitHub Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.
